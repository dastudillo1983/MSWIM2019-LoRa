@article{Meng2008,
abstract = {In this paper, the rainfall is found to have distinct effect on various parts of the propagating components for the VHF radio wave propagation in a tropical forest. By the studies of the measured power delay profiles under different weather conditions, it is observed that the lateral wave is the dominant mode of the VHF propagation and is not affected by the presence of rain as it is similar to free space propagation over the tree tops, while the significant multipath components which propagate through the forest medium is heavily influenced. This is again verified through the estimated delay spread statistics.},

abstract = {This work reports Received Signal Strength (RSS) at 868/915/2400 MHz utilizing RF equipment and Matlab simulations in Forest and Plantation (Mango {\&} Guava) Environments. Path loss, Vegetation water content and corresponding Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) values were deduced from the measured RSS from various positions in foliage environments using unit gain omnidirectional antennas at 1m height from the ground. Empirical foliage loss prediction models such as Cost 235, ITU-R and Weissberger models were compared with the experimental results. The research work presented in this paper is predominately targets characterizing short-range near ground radio link for Wireless Sensor Communications/Networks in vegetation environments.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of radio wave propagation through the forest, with a focus on the evaluation of propagation loss. We present considerations that, according to our belief, should be taken into account when designing a wireless sensor network system to be deployed in a forest environment. Apart from theoretical analysis we present evaluation of example data measured using two ZigBee communication devices operating on frequency 868MHz.},
