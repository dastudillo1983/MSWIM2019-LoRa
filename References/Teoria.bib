  Abstract                 = {This book presents an in-depth study on the recent advances in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The authors describe the existing WSN applications and discuss the research efforts being undertaken in this field. Theoretical analysis and factors influencing protocol design are also highlighted. The authors explore state-of-the-art protocols for WSN protocol stack in transport, routing, data link, and physical layers. Moreover, the synchronization and localization problems in WSNs are investigated along with existing solutions. Furthermore, cross-layer solutions are described. Finally, developing areas of WSNs including sensor-actor networks, multimedia sensor networks, and WSN applications in underwater and underground environments are explored. The book is written in an accessible, textbook style, and includes problems and solutions to assist learning. Key Features: The ultimate guide to recent advances and research into WSNs Discusses the most important problems and issues that arise when programming and designing WSN systems Shows why the unique features of WSNs – self-organization, cooperation, correlation -- will enable new applications that will provide the end user with intelligence and a better understanding of the environment Provides an overview of the existing evaluation approaches for WSNs including physical testbeds and software simulation environments Includes examples and learning exercises with a solutions manual; supplemented by an accompanying website containing PPT-slides. Wireless Sensor Networks is an essential textbook for advanced students on courses in wireless communications, networking and computer science. It will also be of interest to researchers, system and chip designers, network planners, technical mangers and other professionals in these fields.},

  Abstract                 = {Key features and benefits of using Bluetooth 5.0 Increased bandwidth for Bluetooth {\textregistered} technology with low energy Bluetooth 5.0 introduces a new capability to increase the bandwidth to 2 Mbps. By doubling the amount of data that devices can transfer, Bluetooth 5.0 reduces the time required for transmitting and receiving data, facilitating rapid and reliable over-the-air firmware updates for mobile devices and fast upload of days' worth of collected data from a sensor when a mobile device is turned on. Increased range for low energy enables whole-home, building, or location coverage Bandwidth can be decreased to achieve up to 4x longer range while maintaining similar power requirements. With quadruple the range over which their devices can transmit and receive data, product designers creating home automation and security solutions can provide coverage of an entire home, building, or locality. The range can be tuned for a variety of environments. Not every application requires the same range, speed or broadcasting capability. Bluetooth 5.0 provides the flexibility for a developer to make the best choice for their implementation.},

Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are well suited for long-term environmental data acquisition for IoT representation. This paper presents the functional design and implementation of a complete WSN platform that can be used for a range of long-term environmental monitoring IoT applications. The application requirements for low cost, high number of sensors, fast deployment, long lifetime, low maintenance, and high quality of service are considered in the specification and design of the platform and of all its components. Low-effort platform reuse is also considered starting from the specifications and at all design levels for a wide array of related monitoring applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Node localization is one of the basic problem in wireless sensor networks. The localization method based on RSSI measurement is studied in this paper. Because the RF signals is affected by the environment, the exact distance between the nodes can not obtain by RSSI measurement. The parameters of measurement model are determined by anchor nodes, and further correct the measurement data, which can reduce the measurement error. The above methods can effectively reduce the measurement error. The improved RSSI measurment can improve the accuracy of the unknown nodes localization. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},
