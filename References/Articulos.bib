  Abstract                 = {Although short range wireless communication explicitly targets local and very regional applications, range continues to be an extremely important issue. The range directly depends on the so called link budget, which can be increased by the choice of modulation and coding schemes. Especially, the recent transceiver generation comes with extensive and flexible support for Software Defined Radio (SDR). The SX127x family from Semtech Corp. is a member of this device class and promises significant benefits for range, robust performance, and battery lifetime compared to competing technologies. This contribution gives a short overview into the technologies to support Long Range (LoRa {\&}{\#}x2122;), describes the outdoor setup at the Laboratory Embedded Systems and Communication Electronics of Offenburg University of Applied Sciences, shows detailed measurement results and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of this technology.},

  Abstract                 = {New transceiver technologies have emerged which enable power efficient communication over very long distances. Ex- amples of such Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies are LoRa, Sigfox and Weightless. A typical application scenario for these technologies is city wide me- ter reading collection where devices send readings at very low frequency over a long distance to a data concentra- tor (one-hop networks). We argue that these transceivers are potentially very useful to construct more generic Inter- net of Things (IoT) networks incorporating multi-hop bi- directional communication enabling sensing and actuation. Furthermore, these transceivers have interesting features not available with more traditional transceivers used for IoT net- works which enable construction of novel protocol elements. In this paper we present a performance and capability analysis of a currently available LoRa transceiver. We de- scribe its features and then demonstrate howsuch transceiver can be put to use efficiently in a wide-area application sce- nario. In particular we demonstrate how unique features such as concurrent non-destructive transmissions and car- rier detection can be employed. Our deployment experiment demonstrates that 6 LoRa nodes can form a network covering 1.5 ha in a built up environment, achieving a potential life- time of 2 year on 2 AA batteries and delivering data within 5 s and reliability of 80{\%}.},

  Abstract                 = {Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) networks are making spectacular progress from design, standardisation, to commercialisation. At this time of fast-paced adoption, it is of utmost importance to analyse how well these technologies will scale as the number of devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) inevitably grows. In this letter, we provide a stochastic geometry framework for modelling the performance of a single gateway LoRa network, a leading LPWA technology. Our analysis formulates unique peculiarities of LoRa, including its chirp spread-spectrum modulation technique, regulatory limitations on radio duty cycle, and use of ALOHA protocol on top, all of which are not as common in today's commercial cellular networks. We show that the coverage probability drops exponentially as the number of end-devices grows due to interfering signals using the same spreading sequence. We conclude that this fundamental limiting factor is perhaps more significant towards LoRa scalability than for instance spectrum restrictions. Our derivations for co-spreading factor interference found in LoRa networks enables rigorous scalability analysis of such networks.},

The most important requirements on LPWANs include long battery lifetime, low price of devices, ability to connect millions of devices and long range coverage; the long range coverage is the most critical issue of this technology. In this paper we discuss indoor signal propagation of LoRa technology. At the beginning of the paper, there is an introduction to LoRa technology. Later, the paper presents a measurement of an indoor propagation of LoRa signal in a reinforced concrete building in Prague, the Czech Republic. The measurement is realized with one mobile transmitter and one receiver with a fixed location for each experiment. The measurement is performed for two experiments, one with the receiver in the basement of the building, one with the receiver on the roof of the building. Results of the measurement are graphically visualized for both measurement experiments at the end of this paper and show that the best signal coverage is for the roof location, where it includes also flats of neighboring entrances.},

Low cost, energy-efficiency and longevity of such networks make them perfect candidates for smart city applications. LoRa is a new LPWA standard based on spread spectrum technology, which is suitable for sensor nodes enabling long battery life and bi-directional communication but with low data rates. In this paper, we will demonstrate a use-case inspired model in which, end-nodes with multiple radio transceivers (LoRa/WiFi/BLE) have the option to interconnect via multiple networks to improve communications resilience under the diverse conditions of a smart city of a billion devices. To facilitate this, each node has the ability to switch radio communications opportunistically and adaptively, and this is based on the application requirements and dynamic radio parameters.},

Then we analyze for several illustrative application scenarios the maximum number of end devices which can be served by a single LoRaWAN base station and discuss the spatial distribution of these devices. It is shown that subject to the channel composition and application requirements, a single cell may include several millions of devices. Also, we show that the capacity of the uplink channel available to a LoRaWAN node strongly depends on the distance from the base station and does not exceed 2 kbit/s. In the concluding section we summarize and discuss the obtained results, and point out few issues which need to be taken into account when making an application using LoRa or deploying a LoRa network.},

  Abstract                 = {Up to recently, two main approaches were used for connecting the "things" in the growing Internet of Things (IoT)-one based on multi-hop mesh networks , using short-range technologies and unlicensed spectrum, and the other based on long-range cellular network technologies using corresponding licensed frequency bands. New type of connectivity used in Low-Power Wide Area networks (LPWAN), challenges these approaches by using low-rate long-range transmission technologies in unlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands. In this paper, we do performance testing on one such star-topology network, based on Semtech's LoRa TM technology, and deployed in the city of Rennes-LoRa FABIAN. In order to check the quality of service (QoS) that this network can provide, generally and in given conditions, we conducted a set of performance measurements. We performed our tests by generating and then observing the traffic between IoT nodes and LoRa TM IoT stations using our LoRa FABIAN protocol stack. With our experimental setup, we were able to generate traffic very similar to the one that can be used by real application such as sensor monitoring. This let us extract basic performance metrics, such as packet error rate (PER), but also metrics related specifically to the LoRa physical layer, such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal to Noise ratio (SNR), within various conditions. Our findings provide insight about the performance of LoRa networks, but also about evaluation methods for these type of networks. We gathered measurement data that we make freely available together with the tools we used.},
