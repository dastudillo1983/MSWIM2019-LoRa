@article{Zheng2011,
abstract = {Node localization is one of the basic problem in wireless sensor networks. The localization method based on RSSI measurement is studied in this paper. Because the RF signals is affected by the environment, the exact distance between the nodes can not obtain by RSSI measurement. The parameters of measurement model are determined by anchor nodes, and further correct the measurement data, which can reduce the measurement error. The above methods can effectively reduce the measurement error. The improved RSSI measurment can improve the accuracy of the unknown nodes localization. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},
